# FFmpegScripts
Just a small handful of FFmpeg scripts, mainly for making memes

Literally only has two right now because I'm tired

# TODO
- Make a compilation system to compile between Windows and Linux (like a makefile or a shell script)
- Convert from Batch/Bash to Python?
- Write more funny scripts
- Make Android app to make process easier (already have source for this somewhere, but never made it public on github and lost the PC that originally had the code)
